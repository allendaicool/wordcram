#summary How to build WordCram for your own devious purposes
#labels Phase-Implementation

*Warning!* These directions have been rattled off from memory, so if
something doesn't work, send me a note at wordcram at gmail.

= Requirements =

You'll need:

  * svn
  * eclipse
  * ant, including:
    * ant-contrib
    * [http://code.google.com/p/ant-googlecode/ ant-googlecode-0.0.2]
    * [http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=2240 svnant]
  * Processing
  * jUnit

I'll probably move most of those .jars into a `lib` directory at
somepoint, to make it easier.

= Getting the Source =

Just follow Google's [http://code.google.com/p/wordcram/source/checkout directions for getting the source].

= Building !WordCram =

1. Make a build.properties file in your !WordCram directory, with the following items:

|| *this property...* || *...is the path to:* ||
|| `processing.home` ||  your Processing installation ||
|| `junit.jar.path` || a jUnit jar, at least version 4.5 ||
|| `ant.googlecode.jar.path` ||  the ant-googlecode jar ||
|| `svnant.home` || the directory where the svnant jars live ||
|| `processing.sketchFolder` || your Processing sketch folder ||

(The `processing.sketchFolder` path is used in the `publish.local`
task, which builds !WordCram and updates your Processing installation,
so you can test out your changes quickly.)

2. `cd` into your !WordCram directory, and run `ant`.  This will
create a `build` directory, compile the code, run a few unit tests,
and build a wordcram.jar for you under `build/p5lib/wordcram/library`.

That should be it!  Let me know at wordcram at gmail if you have any
problems.
