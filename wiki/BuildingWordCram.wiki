#summary How to build WordCram from source, for your own devious purposes
#labels Phase-Implementation

*Warning!* These directions have been rattled off from memory, so if
something doesn't work, send me a note at wordcram at gmail.

= Requirements =

You'll need:

  * svn
  * eclipse
  * ant
  * Processing

= Getting the Source =

Just follow Google's [http://code.google.com/p/wordcram/source/checkout directions for getting the source].

= Building !WordCram =

1. Make a build.properties file in your !WordCram directory, with the
a property named `processing.sketchFolder`, set to the path of your
Processing sketch folder.  (It's used in the `publish.local` task,
which builds !WordCram and updates your Processing installation, so
you can test out your changes quickly.)

2. `cd` into your !WordCram directory, and run `ant`.  This will
create a `build` directory, compile the code, run a few unit tests,
and build a wordcram.jar for you under `build/p5lib/WordCram/library`.

That should be it!  Let me know at wordcram at gmail if you have any
problems.
