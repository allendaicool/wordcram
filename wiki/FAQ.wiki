#summary If you're having trouble, look here

There aren't many questions yet, since !WordCram is fairly new, but
this is where they'll go as they get asked.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Why do my words come out fuzzy? =

If you're loading your fonts with [http://processing.org/reference/loadFont_.html loadFont], try using [http://processing.org/reference/createFont_.html createFont] instead.  `loadFont` doesn't work as well for rendering characters at different sizes.

= Why don't any of my words show up? =

Are you using something like `Colorers.pickFrom(0)` or `Colorers.pickFrom(255)`?  Try using `Colorers.pickFrom(color(0))` and `Colorers.pickFrom(color(255))` instead.

Processing internally stores colors as integers, with the alpha in the highest bits, so it sees the integer 0 as colorless and completely transparent.  A !WordCram created with `Colorers.pickFrom(0)` will render the words, they'll just be invisible.

`Colorers.pickFrom()` takes a _bunch_ of colors, so it treats each integer it gets as a Processing color/integer.  This is really a misleading API, and it should be sorted out.

= Can I write to PDF? =

Not yet, but I'm working on it.  If you have any advice on rendering a !PathIterator through Processing, or dealing with java.awt.Shapes and java.awt.geom.* in general, I'd love to hear from you.

For now, if you want a printable !WordCram, you can make it really big.
