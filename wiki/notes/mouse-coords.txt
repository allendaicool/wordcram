ok, so it's working with shapes, w00t!

but now, the SKIPPED words are showing up in the list, if you mouse
around (0,0).

PRETTY DARN SURE this is because the un-placed word's shapes are
hanging out up there, having not yet been translated to their location.

so, you want to ignore the skipped words.

which suggests a change: add methods skippedBecause() and wasSkipped()
to Word:

private String skipReason;
public void skippedBecause(String reason) {
  skipReason = reason;
}
public String skippedBecause() {
  return skipReason();
}
public boolean wasSkipped() {
  return skipReason != null;
}
(later, you could implement these as properties?)

then you can implement printSkippedWords() in terms of those methods.

TODO don't forget to javadoc it.
