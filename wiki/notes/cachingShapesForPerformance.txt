so we want to move to a cache of shapes, because:
it gives us a cache we can re-render w/ diff. colors (no biggie)
AND because it lets us know, before we start drawing all,
when we'll stop.

WHY is that such a big performance improvement?
just caching the shapes isn't very compelling.
is there a way we can get the same improvement WITHOUT such a change?

hmm, going back & forth, seems like it might NOT be such a huge improvement.
did it come from one of the other changes I commented out?
something like:
- minWordRenderedSize = 2 -> 4  !!!  this seems to affect it
- maxAttempts = (math) -> 10000

actually, just stopping at maxWords or something (which happens
when you render shapes up-front, and then stop, i guess...)
seems to have a big effect.
